### What I learned

This project really helped me practice working with APIs and asynchronous code in Javascript.

### Continued development

I plan to fix and rework any mistakes and imperfections that might be found and marked by the community.

### Useful resources

- [Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) This article by MDN really helped review how to use the Fetch API and handle asynchronous code.
